      <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Prithvi cafe</kbd></h4>

      <hr>
      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">I had visited in dec 2018</h5>

      <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

      <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Kerala Boat House</kbd></h4>

      <hr>
      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">I want to visit this place in India</h5>

      <p class="text-muted">I can already feel the gentle sway of the houseboat as it glides through the tranquil backwaters of Kerala. The sun-kissed morning, with its golden rays dancing on the water’s surface, beckons me to step aboard. The air is thick with the fragrance of jasmine and coconut palms, and the rhythmic lapping of water against the boat’s hull creates a soothing melody. As I settle into the cozy cabin, I imagine sipping freshly brewed chai, watching the world go by – a symphony of emerald-green paddy fields, vibrant birdlife, and the occasional glimpse of a fisherman casting his net. Kerala’s houseboats promise not just a journey but a timeless escape, where time slows down, and nature cradles you in its arms.</p>

      <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Gyeongbokgung</kbd></h4>

      <hr>
      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">I Want to Visit This place in South Korea</h5>

      <p class="text-muted">If you ask the people you meet in Seoul what you absolutely must do with your time in the city, most will include Gyeongbokgung Palace somewhere on their list (for good reason). This magnificent palace was built in 1395, so not only is it one of the most beautiful man-made structures in the world, it’s also over 600 years old! This palace is the largest of the Five Grand Palaces, and as such, it’s a quintessential piece of Korean history. The kings of the Joseon dynasty lived in this palace, and its design and architecture reflect that — it is very clearly fit for royalty.

        A little over one hundred years ago, Imperial Japan destroyed most of the palace, which was devastating for Korea. While it is still being restored to this day, it is an absolutely amazing complex that will take you hours to see in its entirety. The complex is also home to two different museums, The National Folk Museum and The National Palace Museum of Korea.

    <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>
